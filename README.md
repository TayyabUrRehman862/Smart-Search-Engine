# 🔎 AI-Powered Research Search Engine

A smart search tool that combines **Google Custom Search API** and **Wikipedia** with AI-powered summarization.  
Instead of just showing raw results, it fetches and cleans the most relevant pages, deduplicates them, and generates a **concise, human-like summary** alongside the sources.  

The interface is built with **Gradio**, featuring a modern responsive design, source display, and loading indicators for a smooth experience.
